Pathfinding: Bug 2 > Greedy fallback
Comms:
  [
    ints 1-3: SPAWN COORDINATION
    ints 4-?: UNIT ROLE ASSIGNMENT
  ]

Generally:
- Ducks approach and pick-up flags at spawn to assign themselves as flag-bearers UNLESS it is setup and
    the flag is in the centermost spawn
- On turn one, first bot creates a list of all spawns and writes it to ints 1-3.
- On turn one, first bot assigns himself a Better ID and all bots assign themselves the next on their turn

Duck roles:
[3 MAX] FLAG BEARER (Self-assign if carrying flag):
    - DURING SETUP:
        - Take flag to center-most spawn
        - Drop, wait for setup to end.
        - TODO: What if flag-bearer cannot reach mid spawn?
    - AFTER SETUP:
        - Take flag, head to map edge, and move back and forth
        - Hide from enemies in vision range

[~30%] FLAG DEFENDER (Assign by comms IF (IN RANGE OF FLAG-BEARER once flag-bearer puts up bit-call) OR (CLOSEST TO FLAG-BEARER and is BASE DEFENDER once dead defender puts up bit-call):
    - Follow flag-bearer
    - Attack if in range of enemies, prioritize closest to flag-bearer
    - CHASE ENEMY FLAG-BEARERS
    - When dead, put up bit-call for another flag defender

[~60%] BASE DEFENDER (Default role)
    - All stick around mid spawn
    - Spread out if flag-bearer passing through
    - Attack, build, and heal. Prioritize enemies carrying flag or closest to spawn
    - Restrict to some max distance from mid spawn. (Enough to move, not too much as to leave spawn undefended)
    - Spam traps and moats. Attack if can't build. Heal whenever not attacking.

=====================================================================================================

comms would look like:
int 1: [12 bits spawn 1] [4 bits spawn 2]
int 2: [8 bits spawn 2] [8 bits spawn 3]
int 3: [4 bits spawn 3] [12 bits free?]

int 4: Numbers 1-50 for Better ID assignment

int 5: [12 bits for flag bearer 1, empty if no flag bearer]
int 6: [x < 16 bits for flag defenders to assign themselves to]
int 7: [12 bits for flag bearer 2, empty if no flag bearer]
int 8: [x < 16 bits for flag defenders to assign themselves to]
int 9: [12 bits for flag bearer 2, empty if no flag bearer]
int 10: [x < 16 bits for flag defenders to assign themselves to]
